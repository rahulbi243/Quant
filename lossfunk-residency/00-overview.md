## What Is Lossfunk?

A research lab in Bangalore for "independent minds exploring foundational questions" in AI.
NOT a startup accelerator. NOT a co-founder matching service.

### Research Focus Areas
- Consciousness & Brain dynamics
- AI Safety & General Intelligence
- Deep Learning (continual learning, sample efficiency, representation learning)
- AI Agents (long-horizon tasks, stateful specialization)
- Philosophy & Ethics (moral decision-making via AI)
- Foundational Physics
- AI for Science

### Recent Publications (2025-2026)

## What the Residency Provides
- Structured 6-week focus period
- Cross-disciplinary learning with ~10 diverse AI specialists
- Workspace in Indiranagar, Bangalore
- Access to investor and researcher networks (IISc, GenAI Bangalore, Fifth Elephant)
- Lifelong peer community

## What It Does NOT Provide
- No mentorship, stipends, housing, or food
- Self-directed — minimal structure imposed

## What They Want in an Applicant

### YES
- Deep intrinsic curiosity about AI (would do this work for free)
- Intermediate-to-advanced AI + coding skills
- Research mindset (exploration > products)
- Willingness to open-source
- 15+ hours/week commitment, in-person

### NO
- API wrapper builders
- Startup pitches / co-founder seekers
- Beginners (borderline cases evaluated individually)

## CHOSEN DIRECTION

**Project: "Think Before You Trade"**
Combining Tangent A (TSMOM Discovery) + Tangent E (Entropy-Guided Finance)

> Can sequence-level entropy in LLM reasoning traces predict when
> time-series momentum forecasts are reliable — and does this create
> a better momentum strategy than classical TSMOM?
